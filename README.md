# 2025SE-Roman.Lacbungan-LineDriver

The Line Driver offers a way of transportation through automation and avoids obstacles it may encounter. The included microcontroller allows the use of a display for handling errors as well as being a visual indicator for the car’s status. A three-wheel design was possible, with two continuous servos being configurable and connected to an OOP system.  

More features will be added along the way, including a speaker and Bluetooth connectivity. We hope our invention will pave the way for robot use in various industrial storage warehouses. 

Benefits: 
* The robot should allow ease of configuration. 
* The robot should be secure using OOP and encapsulation. 
* The robot’s status should be displayed through a user-friendly interface. 

Objectives: 
* The robot should follow a black line. 
* The robot should avoid any obstructions/objects. 
* The robot should handle errors and display them to the end-user. 

Goals: 
* End-users should be able to utilise these machines with ease.
